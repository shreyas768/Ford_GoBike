# Ford-GoBike

Overview: This project Ford GoBike dataset of Year 2019 (till July). GoBike is the Bay Area's new bike share system, with thousands of public bikes for use across the greater San Francisco Bay area. An app was also created to co-piloting for getting around town. For more information on this program, please go to https://www.fordgobike.com. Our analysis covers data from Jan 2019 to July 2019

13. End Station Longitude
14. Start Station Latitude
15. Start Station Longitude

#### Steps:-
Our task is to Gather, Wrangle and Clean the data, so as to make it ready for Visualization and answer questions like:- 

1. When are most trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week, or month of the year?
2. People of which age group takes most rides?
3. How long (duration) does the average trip take?
4. Which is a more popular ride coming from, a subscriber or customer?
5. How does number of trips vary in a particular day?

#### Summary:-
I found that Subscribers tend to rent the bikes for longer trips ( generally above 300 minutes ). One possible way to increase revenue is to attract more potential customers and convert more existing customers to subscribers. Further, there is a need to attract Female customers, possibly by giving them attractive offers. We also noted that, number of rides goes down during weekend and peaks during morning and evening, and in the months of March and April. Thus, fare could be decided based on these findings, (like: offering low prices when demand is low), so as to optimise the business.
